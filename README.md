### OVERVIEW
This project implements a real-time chat application using Java sockets and multithreading. It consists of a server that manages multiple client connections and facilitates seamless communication between users.

### Features
1. ***Client-Server Architecture***: A centralized server handles multiple clients simultaneously.
   
2. ***Multithreading***: Each client connection runs on a separate thread, ensuring smooth communication.
   
3. ***Real-Time Messaging***: Clients can send and receive messages instantly.
   
4. ***Efficient Communication***: Uses TCP sockets for reliable data transfer.
   
5. ***Scalability***: Designed to support multiple users without performance degradation.
   
### Technologies Used
1. Java (JDK 8+)
   
2. Socket Programming (ServerSocket and Socket)
   
3. Multithreading (Thread and ExecutorService)
   
4. I/O Streams (BufferedReader, PrintWriter)
   
### How It Works
1. The server starts and listens for incoming client connections.
   
2. When a client connects, the server assigns it a dedicated thread.
   
3. Clients can send messages, which the server broadcasts to all connected users.
   
4. The application ensures smooth message delivery and handles client disconnections gracefully.
   
This project is a practical implementation of socket programming and multithreading in Java, demonstrating efficient network communication. It is ideal for learning real-time client-server interaction and concurrency management.
